<h1>Dice Game</h1>
<hr>
<h2>Welcome.</h2>
<h3>Here are rules:</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Roll the dice to start the game.</li>
	<li>If your first roll is a 7 or 11, you win.</li>
	<li>If your first roll is a 2, 3 or 12, you lose.</li>
	<li>Anything else becomes your goal. Roll your goal again before rolling a 7, and you win. Roll a 7 instead of your goal, and you lose.</li>
</ul>
